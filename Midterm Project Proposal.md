## Project Proposal: Gentrification in Los Angeles Chinatown (CCED Research)

### Research Question
How have low income residents been displaced by real-estate development and policy changes in LA Chinatown? What demographics have been most affected?

Midterm Research Parameters: 
Assessor’s Data
Parcel type/building type
Parcel’s land value
Parcel total value (includes buildings on parcel)
LA Housing Department Data
Rent Stabilized Units
Census Demographic data
Rent
Income

### Significance
In Fall 2022, our group members began a partnership with Chinatown Community for Equitable Development (CCED) in Marques Vestal’s Histories and Theories of Planning class. The partnership was to assist CCED in their work to prevent displacement of current Chinatown residents by providing information on key Chinatown players, legislative tracking, and spatial data mapping. As a group, we have decided to continue our research on Chinatown and hope our efforts can provide CCED with the information needed to adequately plan actions. Chinatown is currently one of the hottest locations for development, especially for market-rate housing, so our efforts are especially timely as gentrification and displacement occur at rapid rates. As all five of our group members are connected to the larger Asian diaspora, we believe institutions like Chinatown are important places to protect for the cultural institutions they offer, especially in our time of growing anti-Asian violence.

### Scope of Work
This project seeks to understand flows of people and capital in and out of Los Angeles Chinatown over the span of 15 years, from 2006 to 2021. This time frame captures a few key policy and zoning changes that we’re interested in: the Cornfield Arroyo Seco Specific Plan passed in 2013, and the implementation of the Transit Oriented Communities Plan in 2016.

We are specifically interested in “gentrification” which is “a process of neighborhood change that includes economic change in a historically disinvested neighborhood —by means of real estate investment and new higher-income residents moving in – as well as demographic change – not only in terms of income level, but also in terms of changes in the education level or racial make-up of residents,” as defined by [UC Berkeley’s Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/about/what-are-gentrification-and-displacement/). Gentrification is identified as a catalyst for involuntary displacement, through eviction and decreasing affordability of housing, and is observed to impact many of Chinatown’s residents. Our research will thus identify and track changes in spatial and demographic indicators such as: 
Changes in parcel type and value
Proposed Developments
Rent Stabilized Units
Household Income
Gross Rent

### Focus Area
Chinatown Community for Equitable Development (CCED) is an anti-gentrification organization based in Chinatown. Chinatown lies on the edge of Downtown Los Angeles and is bounded by I-110, Los Angeles River, and Dodger Stadium (or Elysian Park). CCED organizes tenants and works in coalition across Los Angeles, especially in gentrifying neighborhoods near Chinatown.
This project will focus on Chinatown, as described by the LA Times Neighborhood boundaries ([neighborhood boundaries](https://services5.arcgis.com/7nsPwEMP38bSkCjy/arcgis/rest/services/LA_Times_Neighborhoods/FeatureServer) as defined by the [Los Angeles Times’ Mapping LA project](https://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/)).

### Intended Analysis and Visualizations- should change
Moving forward we hope to zoom in on specific new developments in Chinatown and measure statistical correlation between those projects and neighborhood demographic changes. Hopefully we can overlay this data with Ellis Act eviction locations, to get a better understanding of the spatial implications of policies and programs in LA. We would like to continue our time series analysis, but hone in our focus on specific/new developments and see if they have a statistical impact on changes at the neighborhood level. 

We draw inspiration for map layouts and definitions from [UC Berkeley’s Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/maps/california-estimated-displacement-risk-model/). Additionally, in partnership with CCED we hope to zoom in on specific past market rate developments and their impact on neighborhood communities - we plan to use [UCLA’s geocoder tool](https://gis.ucla.edu/geocoder) for this purpose.

### Conclusions
Our research up to the midterm supports our hypothesis that there has been displacement in Chinatown over the past 15 years, accompanied by similar changes to the spatial environment. However, we do not have the tools to see if there is statistical correlation between the two phenomena. We would like to attempt drawing a more concrete picture by looking more specifically at recently completed developments and exploring residential/demographic changes around those developments prior to and after completion. The purpose of our project is still to visualize levels of gentrification in Chinatown, and to support CCEDs work in proposing mitigation strategies to create and equitable environment for Chinatown residents.
